# Review System Implementation Summary

## Overview

The review system has been completely redesigned to integrate ratings with comments, ensuring one review per user per recipe and displaying ratings alongside user comments.

## Key Changes

### 1. Database Schema Changes

- **Added `rating` column to `comments` table**: Optional integer field (1-5) for star ratings
- **Allows multiple comments per user**: Users can have multiple comments per recipe for questions and discussions
- **Ensures one review per user**: Partial unique index ensures only one comment with rating per user per recipe
- **Added performance index**: `idx_comments_recipe_user` for optimized queries
- **Removed `ratings` table**: Completely dropped the separate ratings table since we're consolidating into comments
- **Created compatibility views**: `recipe_ratings` and `recipe_average_ratings` for potential future needs

### 2. TypeScript Types Updated

- **Updated `types/supabase.ts`**: Added `rating` field to comments table definition and removed ratings table
- **Updated all Recipe types**: Changed from `ratings?: { rating: number }[]` to `comments?: { rating: number | null }[]`

### 3. Comments Component Overhaul (`components/Comments.tsx`)

- **Multiple comments per user**: Users can add multiple comments for questions and discussions
- **One review per user**: Only one comment with rating per user per recipe
- **Smart review management**: Adding a rating to a new comment removes rating from previous comment
- **Two comment sections**: "All Comments" and "Reviews Only" tabs
- **Rating restrictions**: Recipe owners can comment but cannot rate their own recipes
- **Visual improvements**: Ratings displayed next to user info with star icons
- **Edit functionality**: Users can edit both comment content and rating
- **Real-time updates**: Immediate UI updates when comments/ratings are modified

### 4. Updated All Recipe Display Pages

Updated the following pages to use the new comments-based rating system:

#### `app/recipes/[id]/page.tsx` (Recipe Detail Page)

- Fetch ratings from `comments(rating)` instead of `ratings(rating)`
- Updated rating calculation to filter non-null ratings from comments
- Modified rating display to show count of actual ratings

#### `app/recipes/page.tsx` (Browse Recipes)

- Updated query to fetch `comments(rating)`
- Modified `getAverageRating()` and added `getRatingsCount()` functions
- Updated rating display in recipe cards

#### `app/categories/[slug]/page.tsx` (Category Recipes)

- Updated to use comments-based rating system
- Modified rating calculation and display logic

#### `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (Dashboard)

- Updated recent recipes query to use `comments(rating)`
- Modified rating display in recipe cards

#### `app/profile/page.tsx` (Profile Overview)

- Updated user recipes and favorites queries
- Modified rating calculations for profile statistics

#### `app/profile/recipes/page.tsx` (User's Recipes)

- Updated to fetch and display ratings from comments
- Fixed return type consistency for rating calculations

#### `app/profile/favorites/page.tsx` (Saved Recipes)

- Updated favorites query to include `comments(rating)`
- Modified rating display and calculations

## New Features

### 1. Conversational Comments System

- Users can add multiple comments per recipe for questions and discussions
- Comments can be with or without ratings
- Recipe owners and users can have back-and-forth conversations

### 2. Smart Review Management

- Users can add a rating to any of their comments (making it a review)
- Only one comment with rating per user per recipe is allowed
- Adding a rating to a new comment automatically removes rating from previous comment
- Clear warning when user is about to override their existing review

### 3. Dual Comment Views

- **All Comments Tab**: Shows all comments (with and without ratings) for discussions
- **Reviews Only Tab**: Shows only comments with ratings for quick review browsing
- Tab counters show number of comments in each category

### 4. Enhanced User Experience

- **Clear labeling**: Comments vs Reviews are clearly distinguished
- **Warning system**: Users are warned when they're about to override their review
- **Flexible commenting**: Users can ask questions without being forced to rate
- **Review flexibility**: Users can turn any comment into a review by adding a rating

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Performance Optimizations

- Database index on `(recipe_id, user_id)` for faster comment queries
- Efficient rating calculations using filtered arrays
- Reduced database queries by combining comment and rating data

### 2. Data Integrity

- Unique constraint ensures data consistency
- Check constraint validates rating values (1-5)
- Proper null handling for optional ratings

### 3. Backward Compatibility

- Created database views for potential future migration needs
- Maintained existing API patterns where possible
- Graceful handling of missing rating data

## Migration Instructions

See `apply-migration.md` for detailed database migration steps to be applied through Supabase dashboard.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test comment creation with and without ratings
2. Verify one comment per user constraint
3. Test comment/rating updates
4. Verify recipe owner restrictions
5. Test rating calculations and displays across all pages
6. Verify real-time UI updates
